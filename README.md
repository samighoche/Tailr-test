===================  

Tailr is a recommender system for online clothing size purchases.  
Tailr recommends sizes of an item to a user based on their previous rating history as well as the ratings of other people, combined in a graph database. 

We evaluate the efficiency of different kinds of graph traversal algorithms, including a few hybrid approaches that we created.  
Details in the paper.
